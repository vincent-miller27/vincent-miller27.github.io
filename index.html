        <p>I am an avid learner and trying to absorb as much information as possible, which is why I started self-learning how to code during my free-time after graduationg from Ohio State with a degree in Strategic Communication. I soon realized that I have a much greater passion for coding than for marketing, partly do to the fact of consistantly using problem solving techinques and the endless learning opportunities that programming provides. This is why I decided to change career paths and join the .NET Bootcamp at Tech Elevator. After graduating from Tech Elevator I want to obatin a job as a junior developer in an environment where I can continue to learn and gain expertise.</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me with the information provided on my portfolio or connect with me on LinkedIn. An attachment to my portfolio is provided on my profile page under the 'GitHub' link! I am open to learning any programming language, but have the utmost interest in learning Ruby, Python and Swift.</p>

            I am an avid learner and I am always trying to absorb as much information as possible, which is why I started self-learning how to code during my free-time after graduating from Ohio State with a degree in Strategic Communication. I soon realized that I have a much greater passion for coding than for marketing, partly do to the fact of consistently using problem solving techniques and the endless learning opportunities that programming provides. This is why I decided to change career paths and join the .NET Bootcamp at Tech Elevator. After graduating from Tech Elevator I want to obtain a job as a junior developer in an environment where I can continue to learn and gain expertise.
